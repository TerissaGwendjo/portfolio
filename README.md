<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, here is my Portfolio</h1>
<h4 align="left">This Project is all about my Portolio. I created a Website where I tell you a bit about myself, my Educational Background, skills and whatnot. To be able to create this Website, I used tools like html and css</h4>
<p align="left"> 
  I started by linking my style.css file to my index.html file by including it in the head as well as the fontawesome link for my icons. Secondly, I created a header with an unordered list with all intended parameters such as Educational background, skills and contact information. The header's position was set to sticky, center and z-index 99</p>

  Then I went ahead by creating sections with flex boxes were I added my text on the left and picture on the right of the page with some hover effects as well as beat effects for the icons. The result can be seen on the screenshot below. To see full link check my page</p>
